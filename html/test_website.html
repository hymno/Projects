    This is the first journal entry. I'm writing this as I'm sitting on a plane heading for Maui.
    I'm reading Kuhn's book on scientific revolutions and it's getting me to think about the psychologist Dr. Jordan
    Peterson's notions of truth; he says there's a scientific truth and a moral truth. I was very resistant to it,
    but the statement became more digestible as I remembered that truth is never absolute, so why not have different
    varieties? As humans, we <i>decide</i> truth. Someone makes a statement about anything (scientific, moral, or
    otherwise) and the rest listen and see whether or not the evidence produces logical contradictions. And if not, we
    just <i>decide</i> that that's the truth. There's no answer key or crib sheet for the truth hiding out in the crab
    nebula somewhere, it's just the collection of all statements that people have ever decided are true. And they're
    never absolutely true, but perhaps some are what could be called "true enough", or true in the pragmatic sense that
    they wouldn't exhibit any meaningful contradictions or inspire decisions that lead us to harm.
</p>
<p>
    That being said, moral truth seems much more difficult to get to the bottom of than scientific truth. What I think
    Peterson means by moral truth is whether something is right or wrong, and varying degrees in between. But to know
    that, we have to know very intimately what people want. To assess if something is <u>good</u> one has to
    know for whom it may be good, and then establish the set of axioms that define a preexisting set of things that are
    good for that person. Then if you have N people you have to somehow figure out a way to "average out" those axioms
    through an optimization process that minimizes the loss of goodness over N. And if you can't do that very well
    the next thing to try is to segment the population into different groups and cultures of people with locally
    optimized moralities and well, this is what's already naturally taken course over thousands of years of human
    history.
</p>
<p>
    What I'm trying to get at is that our definition of truth should be sympathetic to the impossibility of absolute
    truth. More than that, I would straightaway define truth as the collection of thoughts most optimized to agree
    with physical outcomes. But that's the thing; criteria aside, the physical manifestation of truth is a
    <i>thought.</i>
