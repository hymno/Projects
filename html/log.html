    <i>Exotic looped trajectories of photons in three-slit interference</i>. Super cool. The looped trajectories come
    about from solving the Helmholtz equation for the light waves \( \psi \)
    $$(\nabla + k)\psi = 0$$
    using the following propagator in a Feynman path integral approach:
    $$K(\vec{r}_1, \vec{r}_2) = \int \mathcal{D}[x(\vec{s})] \exp \bigg( ik \int d\vec{s} \bigg)$$
    The above \( K \) perturbatively expands over the allowable paths \( x \):
    $$K = K_1 + K_2 + ...$$
    \( K_1 \) accounts for the normal paths for Borne's rule, while \( K_2 + K_3 + ... \) contain things like the
    looped trajectories! In the paper, they do fancy things to the geometry and conditions of the triple slits in order
    to amplify <i>near field</i> effects which increases the probability densities of the looped trajectories.

    I ended up going with <i>What is life?</i>, <i>Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air</i>, and I
    was lucky enough to score a copy of <i>Memoirs on Heat</i>! Although, <i>On Heat</i> will apparently smell like
    tobacco because it's previous curator was a smoker. Hope it's worth it; it was $90 used (every other available
    edition was $500).<br/><br/>
    I haven't yet mentioned my girlfriend Monica yet in this log; she's lamenting over a paper she submitted which
    was scanned for a similarity score that wasn't ideal in her mind. It's a shame the school system has to stress the
    avoidance of plagiarism so dearly, since the way we're taught to write is through conformity and cliche.

    Somewhere over the pacific ocean. I've now got a list of potential texts that sound interesting;<br/><br/>
    Lavoisier's (and Laplace's) <i>Memoirs On Heat</i><br/>
    Erwin Schrodinger's <i>What is life?</i><br/>
    Benjamin Franklin's <i>Experiments ... on Electricity</i><br/>
    Joseph Priestly's <i>Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air</i><br/><br/>
    Did Ernest Rutherford have any memoirs? Will look that up after landing.

    Flying back to Oakland airport. Want to read more about Clifford algebras but there's no wifi on the plane, so I
    spent a bit of time working on the website. There's a home page now ... whoop dee doo.
    <BR/><BR/>
    On a more interesting note, I thought of a nice set of gifts to give my graduate letter writers. Kuhn's book
    mentions some of the classic texts written by the great scientists of the renaissance era such as <I>Principia</I>
    and <I>Physica</I>, but what took a hold of me were the more obscure texts that were actually pivotal to certain
    momentous paradigm shifts. Of these, there were Priestly's
    <I>Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air</I>, Benjamin Franklin's <I>Electricity</I>, and
    especially
    Lavoisier's writings like <I>Reflexions sur le phlogistique</I>. These texts fought against ideas that are now
    considered archaic relics of the old sciences, and I think my physicist recommenders would have an appreciation for
    the history contained in these writings.
    <BR/><BR/>
    Lavoisier was particularly awesome. He fought tooth and nail to eliminate phlogiston theory (though to it's credit,
    it's a fascinating theory to read about, along with some other wacky theories like the Four Humours medieval theory
    of medicine; references to these now-obscure alchemies is another valuable aspect of these writings IMO)
    and as I understand he was also politically outspoken during the French revolution. Then some people cut off his
    head with a guillotine, which is no fun and his death was protested by his contemporaries, some of the greatest
    scientists in history.

    I didn't get too far, but I did find a connection between the explicit forms of the spacetime metric \(g_{\mu\nu}\)
    and the gamma matrices \( \gamma^\mu \).
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/0501077v1.pdf">Huang, arXiv:gr-qc/0501077</a> is a helpful paper.

    Just got MathJax setup to the webpage. Lets see if this works. I'll try putting my favorite equation:
    $$\delta S = 0$$
    People in physics documentaries are always talking about finding a grand unified theory of nature
    that you can express in an equation less than an inch long, but honestly I think we already have it.

    Had some pretty killer Ahi Poke Tacos at dinner tonight with a chicken entre followed by some french press, so I'm
    staying up a bit tonight. During the week I've been letting my brain wander, thinking about everything from topics
    in ML like <a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/~paskin/">Mark Paskin's</a> thesis on PRF's and slides on Bayesian nets
    to
    this crackpot physics idea I've been thinking about for the past few months.
</p>
<p>
    Every few years or so, some new idea for a paradigm in physics grabs a hold of me. These ideas are usually poorly
    informed as each one has been burned away by simply advancing the number of things I know about how physics works.
</p>
<p>
    For example, when I began coursework at UCSC as an undergrad I had also been reading Erik Verlinde's paper on
    entropic or emergent gravity. I had been inspired also by the emergence of the London dispersion force from the
    theory of electron clouds, and so I devised a metaphysical model in which gravity arose from interlocking
    interference patterns of the summed electrostatic potentials of atoms and molecules, forming a lattice self-reaction
    akin to chinese finger traps between bodies. This was supposed to be a kind of hidden electric field that would be
    globally neutral but on the order of the Planck length showed local variation. Of course it's completely stupid
    because there are particles that don't interact with EM at all which still exhibit gravity, plus I bet if I tried to
    for a single mathematical expression of this I would soon find immediate problems with such a stupid, stupid idea.
</p>
<p>
    Right now I've got myself mulling over a more refined metaphysic, one which seems too simple and generalized to be
    stupid, but still hairpin away from breaking. Here it is: we interpret E = mc^2 to say that
    there is an equivalence between matter and energy. So what if I extend this line of thinking to the bigger of
    Einstein's gifts and say that the field equations imply an equivalence between a spacetime manifold and matter-
    energy. To say that curved space <i>is</i> matter and energy.
</p>
<p>
    Well, I'm not going to get into this idea too much but I've got a concrete expression of this metaphysic that I'm
    going to explore. The actual benefit of doing this is self-education, since I'm sure the chance that it will produce
    any solution or tractable paradigm is 0%. But it's still fun.

    This is the first journal entry. I'm writing this as I'm sitting on a plane heading for Maui.
    I'm reading Kuhn's book on scientific revolutions and it's getting me to think about the psychologist Dr. Jordan
    Peterson's notions of truth; he says there's a scientific truth and a moral truth. I was very resistant to it,
    but the statement became more digestible as I remembered that truth is never absolute, so why not have different
    varieties? As humans, we <i>decide</i> truth. Someone makes a statement about anything (scientific, moral, or
    otherwise) and the rest listen and see whether or not the evidence produces logical contradictions. And if not, we
    just <i>decide</i> that that's the truth. There's no answer key or crib sheet for the truth hiding out in the crab
    nebula somewhere, it's just the collection of all statements that people have ever decided are true. And they're
    never absolutely true, but perhaps some are what could be called "true enough", or true in the pragmatic sense that
    they wouldn't exhibit any meaningful contradictions or inspire decisions that lead us to harm.
</p>
<p>
    That being said, moral truth seems much more difficult to get to the bottom of than scientific truth. What I think
    Peterson means by moral truth is whether something is right or wrong, and varying degrees in between. But to know
    that, we have to know very intimately what people want. To assess if something is <u>good</u> one has to
    know for whom it may be good, and then establish the set of axioms that define a preexisting set of things that are
    good for that person. Then if you have N people you have to somehow figure out a way to "average out" those axioms
    through an optimization process that minimizes the loss of goodness over N. And if you can't do that very well
    the next thing to try is to segment the population into different groups and cultures of people with locally
    optimized moralities and well, this is what's already naturally taken course over thousands of years of human
    history.
</p>
<p>
    What I'm trying to get at is that our definition of truth should be sympathetic to the impossibility of absolute
    truth. More than that, I would straightaway define truth as the collection of thoughts most optimized to agree
    with physical outcomes. But that's the thing; criteria aside, the physical manifestation of truth is a
    <i>thought.</i>
