##Programming, research, and other miscellaneous projects of mine

- Catan stats is some data I gathered while playing Settlers of Catan with friends. It demonstrates a slight bias in the player order.
- LHEF.C is something I wrote to extract the invariant mass of a pair of W bosons from particle data generated by Madgraph/Madevent/Pythia. You can run it with ROOT using the .root file that I provided. Make sure you include the header file LHEF.h in the directory.
