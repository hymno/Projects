##Programming, research, and other miscellaneous projects of mine

- Catan stats is some data I gathered while playing Settlers of Catan with friends. It demonstrates a slight bias in the player order.
- wwMass.C is something I wrote to extract the invariant mass of a pair of W bosons from particle data generated by Madgraph/Madevent/Pythia. In the future I will try provide the appropriate files so that people can try running it and get histograms in ROOT.
